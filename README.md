# GIS_visualizations
Here are several presentations and images of different projects during my masters and summer school project

# üìÅ **Amazon OBIA** Summer School
This project was part of a Summer School that I partially participated in 2020 from the University of Salzburg. 

- Snap tool was used for an Object Based Image Analysis on burnt areas  in a region of the Amazons. 
- Personally worked on the NDVI indices of the regions from Sentinel 2B images.
- Presented the results in the projects during the GEOBIA Summer School

- Other participants: 
    1. Sayana, G., University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria
    1. Leonard L., University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria

    4. VIIRS Active Fires


# üìÅ **Digitization** Sankt Magdalen
Final project of first semester was to digitize the area where our University was located: Sankt Magdalen, Villach, Austria. 

The **main objective** of this project was to have a better understanding and knowledge of how to digitize with ArcGIS. In order to accomplish this objective, with an aerial image of St Magdalen we had to georeference the image and digitize the entire image creating a geodatabase, feature data sets and classes and assigning the attributes in accordance with what the image provides and what we could extract or need from this image.

- The report of the process and results of the digitization 
- The final map composition with the basemap and Legend of all features


# üìÅ **Natural Reserve Forest Fire** Colombia
The main objective of this project was to create different visualizations with anlaysis of forest fires that had occured in a very important Natural Regional Park in Boyaca, Colombia. 

- **Goals**
    1. Visualize the temporal changes of the NDVI from the Natural
        Regional Park through an animation or GIF with ArcGIS and ArcPro
    2. Model the difference of the NDVI from March 2020 and January
        2021 with ArcPro through a 3D visualizations.
